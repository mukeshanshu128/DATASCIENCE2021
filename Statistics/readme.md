Concept of Statistics
 SD & HISTOGRAM
 
 Type of Data: ->Quantitative
                       ->Discrete (information that can only take certain values) (ex:number of players in a team,number of planets in                            the Solar System)
                       ->Continous (Ex:Height, weight, temperature)

              ->Qualitative
                       ->Nominal (Nominal data is defined as data that is used for naming or labelling variables) (ex:country, gender,                             race, hair color)
                       ->Ordinal (Ordinal data is a type of categorical data with an order) (ex:rating,his/her financial happiness                                 level   on a scale of 1-10.)



 STATISTICS: TWO TYPES DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL
  ->MEASURE OF CENTRAL TRENDENCY -
                       ->MEAN 
                       ->MEDIAN 
                       ->MODE
  ->MEASURE OF SPREAD -(Varibility in Data) or (Histrogram help usin gaining of Data spread) or(smaller the spread better the                                   representation of data) or (larger the spread worse is the mean at represent data)
                       ->Range
                       ->Variance-(Average of square distance from Mean)
                       ->Interquatile Range
                       ->Stadard Deviation -(SQUARE ROOT OF VARIANCE)(SD TELLS US HOW CLOSE THE VALUE OF DATASET ARE TO THE MEAN)
                *Practical Approach:  
                        ->Figure outlier in the data
                        ->Standardize data and interpret wrt to mean
                        ->Monitor control system for not normal behaviour
             
                                   
  ->MEASURE OF SHAPE-
                       ->Symetric -Mean = Median = Mode  (BELL CURVE AND Normal distribution curve)
                       ->Skew - 
                               -> +ve skew(Median is less than mean)
                               -> -ve skew(median is more tha mean)
                       ->kurtosis
                               ->Lepokurtic
                               ->Mesokurtic
                               ->Pltykurtic
                  *Practical Approcah:
                           ->Measures of outlier(tails)
                           ->Study effect of outlier of Data
   
   ->Popular Statistics Plot:
                        ->Histogram (Bar Chart vertical & horizontal)
                        ->Scattor Plot
                        ->Pie chart
                        ->Box plots(BOX PLOT GRAPHICALLY DEPICT THE GROUP OF NUMERICAL DATA THROUGH QUATILE)
                        
Inferential Statistics:
         ->understand underlying Data (Spread od data around Mean )
         ->Draw Inference from Data (A/B testing)
         ->Make predection (Spam or Not Spam)
        Understand:
            ->probabilty
            ->Conditional probabliity
            ->Random Variable
            ->Normal distribution 
            ->Hypothesis testing
     
  ->RANDOM VARIABLE : (whose possible values are numerical outcome of random phenomena)
  
                Prababilty=Frequency/Total no of list
                SD
  ->NORMAL DISTRIBUTION:
            ->Mean=Median=Mode
            ->Single peak ->Symetric 
            ->Centered around Probability =0.5
            ->68% data in 1 standard deviation range
            ->+- SD
            ->95% of data 2 Standard Deviation 
            ->NORMAL DISTRIBUTION->STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTION (z-SCORE) AFTER STANDARDIZE
  ->CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM:
            ->SAMPLE DISTRIBUTION CLOSE TO NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
            ->The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently               large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be                           approximately normally distributed.
   ->HYPOTHESIS TESTING:
             ->Hypothesis concerning a population parameter is identified that will be certified true only id sample evidence is 
               suffient.
               Use of Hypothesis testing:
                 Ex:Drug test,legal case & manufacture plant
              ->Null hypothesis
